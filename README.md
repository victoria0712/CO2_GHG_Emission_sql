# CO2_GHG_Emission_sql

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to showcase our SQL skills by analyzing a dataset of CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions. While I cannot include the complete dataset here due to its size, I provide the SQL queries and code used for analysis. The analysis focuses on exploring the data, identifying trends, and deriving meaningful insights.
